# EPUB validation evidence

## 2026-10-20 initial native extraction slice

- Selected `lexepub 0.1.2` from crates.io, Apache-2.0, checksum `6d35d0fae6dc461c3bd7055d8d12ffd9e50ec255f488041d006b8b975bdef596`.
- Reviewed and rejected the common `epub 2.1.5` crate because it is GPL-3.0.
- Default LexePub features are disabled; no CLI, C-FFI, WASM, Embassy, JavaScript, networking, or external executable is used.
- EPUB bytes pass the existing ZIP member/path/member-size/aggregate/compression-ratio preflight before upstream parsing.
- Detection requires the `application/epub+zip` mimetype. `META-INF/encryption.xml`, supplied passwords, missing/malformed package data, empty spines, and incomplete upstream chapter extraction fail explicitly.
- One spine chapter maps to one zero-based compatibility page. This is not physical pagination. Publication metadata and chapter-ordered plain text are eager and owned.
- Rendering and all conversion pairs are explicitly unsupported.

### Validation

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Rust 1.95 formatting | Passed |
| `cargo test --locked` | Passed |
| `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| Installed-wheel Python suite | Passed: 174 tests |
| Generated EPUB bytes/path, metadata, order, ownership | Passed |
| DRM/encryption, malformed package, render/convert errors | Passed |
| Locked license audit | 291 normal/build packages; no undeclared or GPL-/AGPL-/LGPL-only license |
| License inventory copies | Byte-for-byte identical |
| Linux ARM64 CPython 3.13 wheel | 15,912,406 bytes |

The dependency graph adds LexePub's async ZIP, HTML/XML, and unconditional non-WASM Diplomat support dependencies. All are permissively licensed, but the footprint should be compared with a lower-level feature split before release. No ArtCraft revision changed.

## Deferred

Navigation links, images, semantic XHTML blocks/headings, CSS, media overlays, fixed-layout pagination/rendering, conversion, and authoring remain task 8 and require separate acceptance criteria and upstream API review.

## 2026-10-20 semantic extraction and native creation expansion

- Added strict XHTML well-formedness checks and LexePub AST mapping for ordered headings, paragraphs, exact inline links, referenced image bytes/type/alt text, and EPUB 2/3 metadata/spine chapters.
- Fixed detection precedence so affirmative DOCX/PPTX content types cannot be shadowed by a colliding EPUB mimetype member.
- Added native `doc_ex.new("epub" | "ebook")` creation through rbook 0.7.12 (`write` feature only, default features disabled). The semantic append-only API supports required metadata, authors, ordered chapters, headings, paragraphs, inert HTTP(S)/mailto/fragment links, PNG/JPEG/GIF/SVG resources, bytes/path/stream save, copy and close.
- Created EPUBs reopen through the independent LexePub extraction path with metadata, order, headings, links and image bytes preserved. Raw XHTML/OPF/CSS/scripts and caller archive paths are not exposed.
- Added EPUB 2, OOXML collision, malformed XHTML, supplied-password, archive traversal, semantic extraction, image/link, authoring roundtrip, copy, save, close, invalid metadata/heading/link/image tests.
- Rust 1.95 validation passed: 227 tests and Clippy with warnings denied. The complete installed-wheel suite passed: 268 tests.
- Locked license inventory: 298 normal/build packages, no undeclared or GPL-/AGPL-/LGPL-only license; `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` and `LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY` are byte-identical.
- Linux ARM64 CPython 3.13 wheel size: 16,311,442 bytes. rbook authoring adds approximately 399 KiB over the extraction-only EPUB wheel and is accepted for this feature profile.
- Rendering, CSS fidelity, fixed layout, scripts, DRM, media overlays, format conversion and editing existing EPUBs remain explicit non-goals.
